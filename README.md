# Random Processes and SDE's
A repo of code I use to study random processes such as the Wiener process and Brownian bridges as well as numerical solutions of SDE's.
All examples are motivated by the text, "Stochastic Simulation and Applications in Finance with MATLAB Programs" by H.T. Huynh, V.S. Lai, and I. Soumare
